                    Hello! My name is Austin Mann. Ever since I tried programming in high school I have known it is what I want to do as my career.
                    I have lived in Waco my whole life, but I plan to move to Austin, Texas at some point.
                    I have been learning various languages on and off through CodeAcademy and personal projects for over 4 years.
                    I find software development very enjoyable; every problem is almost like a puzzle that has multiple solutions.
                    I look forward to learning more throughout my career and being as successful and competent as I can!
