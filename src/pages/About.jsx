                    Hello! My name is Austin Mann. Ever since I tried programming in high school I have known it is what I want to do as my career. I have lived in Waco my whole life, and
                    I am the oldest of 4 kids. I love playing video games and reading in my spare time. I find software development very enjoyable; every problem is almost like a puzzle that
                    has multiple solutions. I look forward to learning more throughout my career and being as successful and competent as I can!
